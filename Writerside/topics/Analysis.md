# Analysis

The Healthcare E-Prescription App will be a Python-based application designed to streamline the generation and management of electronic prescriptions within the framework of the Czech Architecture of eGovernment. Drawing inspiration from modules such as 
`A1243 Lečiva`, `A1341 Zdravotní pojištění`, `A3726 eRecept`, and `A4006 Národní registr zdravotních pracovníků`, this app is a school project for the subject `Programové vybavení` at the [Secondary technical school of electrical engineering Ječná](https://www.spsejecna.cz/) in Prague.

## Requirements
This app has to fulfill [these requirements](Requirements.md) given by the school.

## Architecture

The app will be built upon a 3-tier architecture, providing a structured and modular design for optimal performance and scalability.

1. **Presentation Layer**
   - Utilize the [customTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) library for a user-friendly and customized graphical interface.
   - The GUI will be designed using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), a collaborative UI/UX design tool.
  
2. **Logic Layer**
   - Created in Python `3.12`, this layer handles the main operations of the application, making sure different parts work smoothly together.
   - The [mysql-connector-python](https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/) library is used to connect to the database.
   - For working with images, the app relies on the [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) library.
   - Managing environment variables is made easy with the [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) library.
   - Generating PDF files is done using the [ReportLab](https://pypi.org/project/reportlab/) library.
   - Generating QR codes is handled by [qrcode](https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/) library.
   - Finally, to send data to users, the [smtplib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html) library is used for email functionality.

3. **Data Layer**
   - MySQL is employed as the database management system to handle the storage and retrieval of healthcare data securely.
