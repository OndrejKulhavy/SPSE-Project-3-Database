## User Interface or API Functionalities

1. **Insertion, Deletion, and Modification of Information: **
   - Allow insertion, deletion, and modification of information/records that are stored in more than one table. For example, inserting an order that has items, etc.

2. **Transactions Across Multiple Tables:**

## Submission

Submit the following:
- **Test Scenarios in PDF Format: **
  - A PDF with a test scenario for running the application, including configuration and database structure import.
  - At least three additional test scenarios in PDF format for testing all the above points, including all types of errors and configuration possibilities.

  - Proper documentation containing everything from Appendix 1â€”Checklist in Czech or English.

## Program Requirements

- The program must react reasonably to all possible errors and may require user cooperation to resolve the issue. This needs to be captured in the test scenarios.

- The program must use design patterns and best practices where appropriate.

- The program does not need to include unit tests; instead, it must include test scenarios for testers. The tester is a person who will test the application.

- Use any programming language or group of languages taught in school or approved by your teacher. Ensure that you do not share your source code with any classmates.
