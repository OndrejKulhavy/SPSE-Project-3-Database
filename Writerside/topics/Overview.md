# Overview

The Healthcare E-Prescription App will be a Python-based application designed to streamline the generation and
management of electronic prescriptions within the framework of the Czech Architecture of eGovernment. Drawing
inspiration from modules such as
`A1243 Lečiva`, `A1341 Zdravotní pojištění`, `A3726 eRecept`, and `A4006 Národní registr zdravotních pracovníků`, this
app is a school project for the subject `Programové vybavení` at
the [Secondary technical school of electrical engineering Ječná](https://www.spsejecna.cz/) in Prague.

For getting started with the app, you can refer to the [Getting Started](Get-Started.md) guide.
